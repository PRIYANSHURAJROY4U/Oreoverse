Immortal was I.\n\nSo, the moment you place my secret chest in your lap,\nA part of me lives, a part of me tries.\n\nIntrigued to the core, when you open its door,\nThe day eases, the day unfolds me.\n\nThe moment you touch the smudged ink on the papers,\nI get resurrected, I breathe a sigh.\n\nThe more you breathe my words, my muse,\nThe more I live, the more I live.\n\n‘Cause I never did nor shall I die\nFor I am immortal. Immortal I lie."
